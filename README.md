### MyInstruments

**MyInstruments** is my capstone project for Code Kentucky's Software Development Part 1. 
This console application was developed to help me manage my collection of musical instruments. 
It is often difficult to recall specific details about each instrument in my collection from memory. 
I am often seeking out information like an instrument's string gauge, serial number and country or age of manufacture. 
An interactive console app makes this process easier, faster and more fun.

The app takes input from the user to print information about the instrument of their choosing on the screen. 
Additionally, it can print a list of all of the instruments recorded in its memory or it can print lists of the instruments by their type.

The long-term goal for this app is to develop a web and/or mobile version that outside users could utilize to store and retrieve data about their own collections.


#### FEATURES
Whenever a "Feature List" item is implemented it is clearly designated in the code comments.

The following items from the "Feature List" are implemented:

⦁	Implement a "master loop" console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.

⦁	Create an additional class which inhereits one or more properties from its parent.

⦁	Create a dictionary or list, populate with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.

⦁	Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.

⦁	Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how mant days remaining until some event).


#### NOTES & INSTRUCTIONS
The easiest way to get started is to type "All" to see a list of all musical instruments available for review. 
Then you can review any instrument individually by typing its name as it appears in the main list. 
Please note that names are case specific and you will have to follow the case as indicated by the main list for valid input (i.e. type "Fender Jazzmaster", "Fender USA Stratocaster", "Hofner Club Bass", etc. to see data about the individual instruments.)
For a list of other commands, type "Commands". Type "Quit" to exit the program.
