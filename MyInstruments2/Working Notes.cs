    // -other functionality ideas with dictionary > look at some other dictionary functionality for other ideas.
    // -print the instruments to a seperate text file and/or csv file
    // -add unit tests for each instrument class that generates the sentences in main
    // -center header text in main
    // -ability to add or delete new instruments in each dictionary - ADD GUITAR, ADD BASS, ADD UKULELE, DELETE GUITAR, DELETE BASS, DELETE UKULELE
    // -user login and password?
    // -make PrintInstrument a method that each of the instrument classes calls versus writing it out in each class.
    // -if i do the step above, need to put unique properties for uke and bass in their own console writelines after calling that method
    // -add classes for pianos/keyed instruments? percussion? other?
    // -make a stringed instrument bass class that takes string-specific properties out of MusicalInstrument
